A collection of simple Bash scripts that I wrote for practice.

Some example:
- Sum-three: Ask user for 3 number then output the total sum of those 3 numbers

- Numbergame: A game about guessing a random number between 0 and 20. Ask user for an input then based on it to display the appropriate message

- Task 5: A script for creating Bash script easier. Ask user for the name of the script then automatically insert "#!/bin/bash" into the file, give it execute permission and open nano for you
